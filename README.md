# Machine Learning Lab Evaluation

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the performance of different machine learning models using a dataset related to fuel cell performance. The evaluation involves selecting a subset of data based on roll numbers, dividing it into training and testing sets, running multiple regression models, and comparing their performance.

## Steps to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- The following Python libraries installed:
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`

### Dataset
Place the dataset `Fuel_cell_performance_data-Full.csv` in the specified directory and update the path in the script.
```bash
python script_name.py
```
## Results
The project evaluates the following models:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
